/**
 * This decorator removes all camelCase property names from the property name collection, if a snake_case version exists.
 * This is a fix for https://github.com/Part-DB/Part-DB-server/issues/862, as the openapi schema generator wrongly collects
 * both camelCase and snake_case property names, which leads to duplicate properties in the schema.
 * This seems to come from the fact that the openapi schema generator uses no serializerContext, which seems then to collect
 * the getters too...
